# Multifractal analysis of natural images
This repository contains the code and report of a short school project on modelling natural images with multifractal images. The code shows examples of applications to texture generation and virtual super-resolution. The report contains a short theoretical development with some details on the models used. This work was undertaken under the supervision of Gabriel Peyr√© and is largely inspired by two papers from Pierre Chainais, "Infinitely Divisible Cascades to model the statistics of natural images" and "Virtual super resolution of scale invariant textured images using multifractal processes".

Please feel free to report any errors in the code or typos in the report.
